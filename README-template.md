## Overview

I created a QR code webpage based on Frontend Mentor's design. The webpage uses CSS variables and Google Fonts API for styling, and the QR code image is loaded from the project directory. The container has a border radius and box shadow for visual appeal, and the text container uses flexbox to align its contents. I added attribution to Frontend Mentor and a link to my GitHub profile.

## My process

To create the QR code component webpage, I followed a step-by-step process. First, I reviewed the design provided by Frontend Mentor and made note of the different components required. Then, I used HTML and CSS to create the basic structure of the webpage, focusing on layout and responsiveness.

Next, I added the QR code image using CSS and made sure it was displayed correctly on all screen sizes. I also used CSS variables and the Google Fonts API to style the text elements and apply custom fonts.

Finally, I added finishing touches such as a border radius and box shadow to the container and centered the text elements using flexbox. I also added an attribution comment to credit Frontend Mentor and myself for the design and development work, respectively. Throughout the process, I tested the webpage on different devices and browsers to ensure it was functional and visually appealing

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned a lot about front-end web development. I gained experience in using CSS variables to create a cohesive design across multiple elements. I also learned how to use the Google Fonts API to add custom fonts to my web pages.

In addition, I learned about responsive design and how to create web pages that can adapt to different screen sizes. I utilized CSS properties such as "box-shadow" and "border-radius" to enhance the visual appeal of my web page.

Finally, I learned how to load images into my web page and adjust their size and shape using CSS. I also gained experience in using flexbox to align and center elements within a container.

Overall, this project allowed me to gain practical experience in various front-end web development concepts and techniques, and I look forward to applying these skills in future projects.
